// settings.local.gradle.kts — the FORK-OWNED module-include seam (white-label, B1/T11).
//
// `settings.gradle.kts` (template-owned, synced) applies this file via `apply(from = ...)` if it exists,
// so a fork adds/removes its own Gradle module includes HERE without editing the template settings file —
// a template sync full-copies `settings.gradle.kts` while these includes survive. This is the
// settings-graph twin of `feature-deps.gradle.kts` (the dependency seam) and the `cmp.navigation.registry`
// runtime seams.
//
// The template ships its backbone + demo module includes in `settings.gradle.kts` itself; this file is the
// empty fork extension point (the customizer `--clean` leaves it empty). `include(...)` is valid here
// because an applied settings script runs in the same `Settings` scope.
//
// Example — add a consumer feature module:
//     include(":feature:my-feature")

// Fork module includes go below this line.
