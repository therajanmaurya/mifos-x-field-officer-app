/**
 * The ONE Gradle-side reader of `gradle/fork.properties`.
 *
 * `app-profile` (app.yaml + platforms) is the fork SoT; `scripts/white-label/derive.rb` materializes
 * it into the derived build-bridge `gradle/fork.properties`; everything downstream READS that bridge.
 * This object is the Gradle end of that contract — the direct counterpart of `fp_get()` in
 * `scripts/product-health/lib.sh`, whose header states the rule this file exists to extend:
 *
 * > "EVERY health check reads it through fp_get() so there is exactly one parser and one SoT —
 * >  a check never re-implements the read."
 *
 * That discipline held inside `scripts/product-health/` and nowhere else: six Gradle files each ran
 * their own `Properties().load()` with three different helper shapes and three different
 * missing-key defaults (`""`, a caller default, and a hardcoded `"App"`). Independent parsers are how
 * the resolution order silently diverges — the 2026-09-06 signing split, where `deployment/Appfile`
 * preferred the FILE and `_shared/project_config.rb` preferred the ENV for the same
 * `apple.team.id`, was exactly that failure at the Ruby layer.
 *
 * ## Semantics
 * - An ABSENT file is not an error. On a fresh clone (`fork.properties` is gitignored — it carries
 *   per-fork filled-in values) every key resolves to its caller-supplied default. Callers must always
 *   pass a default that is safe for an unbranded build.
 * - A key present but blank is treated as ABSENT. `derive.rb` omits placeholder values rather than
 *   writing them, so "" and "missing" mean the same thing: not authored yet.
 * - Reads are cached per [Project] build — the file is parsed once, not once per call site.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 * It does not consult environment variables. `SyncForkConfigPlugin` owns the full override chain —
 * `ENV > app-profile > fork.properties > libs.versions.toml > ""` (SyncForkConfigPlugin.kt:91) —
 * because it WRITES the derived surfaces. A consumer reading the already-derived bridge must not
 * re-litigate that order, or the two disagree again.
