/**
 * Installs the unauthenticated entry destinations on the ROOT graph.
 *
 * The shell owns where sign-in sits, which is why `feature/auth` deliberately does NOT annotate
 * `loginDestination` with `@FeatureDestination`: that annotation registers onto the AUTHENTICATED
 * graph, the one place the gate in front of it must not be. The feature owns the screen; this file
 * owns its placement.
 *
 * Before this existed, `loginDestination` had zero callers anywhere in the tree — `feature/auth`
 * compiled, was included in `settings.local.gradle.kts`, and was absent from the navigation graph,
 * so a logged-out user could not reach a login screen at all.
