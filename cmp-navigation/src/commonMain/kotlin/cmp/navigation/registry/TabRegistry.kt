 * generically, so adding/removing a tab is a ONE-file edit here — no longer a scattered change across a
 * sealed-class + item list + click `when` + NavHost. The backbone Home + Profile tabs are always present
 * (they are the app shell); a fork appends its own via [extraTabs]. Ownership: `owner: fork` in
 * customization-surface.yaml (S6 heal, epic pure-white-label-store5-network T7).

     * editing this file. Empty until some feature annotates one.

     *
     * Any extra tab whose [NavigationItem.inlineTab] is `true` (the default) MUST register its start
     * destination here, so that tapping the tab swaps content WITHIN the scaffold — the bottom bar stays
     * visible and the tab keeps its own back stack, exactly like the backbone Home/Profile tabs. Without
     * an inline registration an `inlineTab = true` tab would have nothing to render inline.
     *
     * The lambda runs with a [NavGraphBuilder] receiver (register destinations here) and receives:
     *  - `innerNav`  — the navbar's inner [NavHostController]; use it for tab-local navigation such as
     *                  returning to the Home tab (`innerNav.navigate(HomeRoute) { … }`).
     *  - `outerNav`  — the OUTER authenticated-graph [NavController]; use it for DRILL-DOWN navigation to
     *                  full-screen feature routes (`outerNav.navigateToItemDetail(id)`), which correctly
     *                  push above the scaffold and hide the bar — the standard drill-down affordance.
     *
     * Registering a tab's top screen here does NOT conflict with also registering it (or its drill-downs)
     * on the outer graph via `FeatureRegistry.featureDestinations` — the two NavHosts are independent, so
     * a screen reachable both as a tab (inline) and as a push from another feature (full-screen) is fine.
     *
     * Template default = no-op (the template ships no inline extra tabs). `owner: fork`.
