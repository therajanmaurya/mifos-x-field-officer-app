/**
 * FeatureRegistry — the FORK-OWNED white-label seam for feature contributions.
 *
 * The template infra modules READ from this registry; a fork extends the app by editing THIS ONE file
 * (+ its build.gradle deps + settings.gradle include), never the template infra files:
 *   - `cmp-navigation/di/KoinModules.kt` includes [featureKoinModules] into the app DI graph.
 *   - `cmp-navigation/.../AuthenticatedNavigation.kt` invokes [featureDestinations] to register routes.
 *
 * Ownership: `owner: fork` in customization-surface.yaml — `sync-dirs`/`white-label-doctor` NEVER
 * overwrite it, so a template sync full-copies the infra modules while your features survive. The
 * template ships this file pre-populated with its demo feature set as the default; a fork replaces the
 * contents with its own (the customizer `--clean` empties both lists).
