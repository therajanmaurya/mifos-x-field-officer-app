/**
 * AppInitializers — the FORK-OWNED white-label seam for app-startup hooks.
 *
 * Each platform app entry point (Android `Application.onCreate`, iOS/desktop `main`) calls [runAll]
 * ONCE, right after Koin is initialized, so a fork can register startup work (analytics init, crash
 * reporting, remote-config prefetch, feature-flag warmup) WITHOUT editing the template-owned entry
 * points. Before this seam a fork had to edit `AndroidApp.onCreate` directly (S3/S4 GAP — no seam);
 * now it adds a hook here. Ownership: `owner: fork` in customization-surface.yaml (epic
 * pure-white-label-store5-network, T7). Template default = no hooks.
