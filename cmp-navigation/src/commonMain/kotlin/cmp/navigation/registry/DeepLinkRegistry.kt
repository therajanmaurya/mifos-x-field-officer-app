/**
 * Fork-owned customization seam for OS **deep links** — the deep-link twin of [FeatureRegistry] /
 * [BackboneRegistry] / [TabRegistry].
 *
 * Inbound URIs (home-screen widget taps, `app://…` links, iOS `openURL`, browser `#`/`?` routes) are
 * captured by the cmp-deep-link library (KmpToolkit, commonMain) — on Android via its auto-init
 * `ContentProvider` + `ActivityLifecycleCallbacks`, so **no Activity wiring is needed** — and parsed into a
 * [DeepLink] on `DeepLinkHandler`. `RootNavScreen` observes `DeepLinkHandler.lastReceived` and, once the
 * user is authenticated and the authenticated graph is on-screen, dispatches the link through [route].
 *
 * The template ships **no** deep links, so the default [route] is a no-op. A fork that adds deep links (e.g.
 * quick-launch widgets) registers ITS mapping ONCE at app start — never editing `RootNavScreen`:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // In the fork's app init (e.g. alongside FeatureRegistry wiring):
 * DeepLinkRegistry.route = { link, navController ->
 *     when (link.host) {
 *         "focus" -> { navController.navigateToFocusSession(); true }
 *         "goals" -> { navController.navigateToDailyGoals(); true }
 *         else    -> false
 *     }
 * }
 * ```

     * link matched a known destination (navigation was issued) so `RootNavScreen` clears the handled link;
