 * The client list — a TOP-LEVEL destination on the authenticated graph, so it is annotated and

 *
 * This file MUST live in a `navigation` package: the generator calls `scan(roots, "navigation")`, so
 * an annotated destination anywhere else is silently skipped and the screen simply does not exist in
 * the app — with a clean build. (A wrong SIGNATURE throws loudly; a wrong PACKAGE does not. Found the
 * hard way in S3a, when `ClientModule` appeared in the Koin aggregate and the destination did not.)
 *
 * The original registered ~38 client destinations through one `clientNavGraph`. Those arrive with
 * their screens across S3a–S3d; nested drill-downs stay nested and are NOT annotated — only
 * top-level entries are (spec §4).
 *
 * Create-client does not exist yet, so it is passed as `null` rather than as an empty lambda — the
 * screen then omits the FAB entirely instead of drawing one that does nothing. S3c supplies it.

 * the Clients TAB renders: the list is the tab's start destination, so the bottom bar stays visible and
 * the tab keeps its own back stack, while the detail drill-down pushes on the OUTER controller and
 * covers the bar — the standard affordance, and the shape `TabRegistry.extraInlineTabDestinations`
 * documents.

 * routes there twice is a duplicate-destination crash at NavHost build.
