/**
 * Client detail — ported from `6b66e8a43:feature/client/clientDetails/ClientDetailsViewModel.kt`.
 *
 * The original carried SIX independent `StateFlow`s for one screen — `clientDetailsUiState`,
 * `loanAccount`, `savingsAccounts`, `profileImage`, `client`, `showLoading` — which could disagree
 * about what was on screen. They become one [ClientDetailState] whose parts are `ScreenState`s, so
 * identity can render while accounts are still loading without either half lying about the other.
 *
 * Four defects in the original, fixed here:
 *
 *  1. `init` called `getUserProfile()` using `clientId.value` from `SavedStateHandle` — still `0` at
 *     construction, so the first profile-image fetch was for client 0. The id is now read ONCE, up
 *     front, and the streams are opened from it.
 *  2. `loadClientDetailsAndClientAccounts()` was PUBLIC and never called from `init`; the screen had
 *     to remember to invoke it, and nothing loaded if it did not. Loading is owned here.
 *  3. `getUserProfile()` swallowed `DataState.Error` into an empty `{}` branch, so a failed photo was
 *     silent. A missing photo is now [ScreenState.Empty] and a failed one is `Error` — the ledger's
 *     §5 decision that "no photo" and "could not load photo" are different facts.
 *  4. `_showLoading` was written by two concurrent collectors, so whichever finished first cleared
 *     the spinner while the other was still running. There is no shared loading flag now; each
 *     stream carries its own state.
