package kpt.core.base.database.annotation

/**
 * Marks a Room `@Entity` as a table of THIS app's database.
 *
 * `tools/database-ksp` collects every annotated class and emits the `@Database(entities = [...])`
 * literal, so a table is declared exactly once — on the entity itself. There is no YAML row to add
 * and no `AppDatabase` region to regenerate.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @DbEntity
 * @Entity(tableName = "banking_loans")
 * data class LoanEntity(...)
 * ```
 *
 * Room needs ONE compile-time `entities = [...]` array inside the `@Database` class, which is why
 * `AppDatabase` is GENERATED WHOLE rather than assembled from a separate bindings object the way
 * `GeneratedStoreBindings` is: an annotation argument cannot be read from a `val`.
 *
 * Deleting a package deletes its annotations, so a stripped demo simply generates a smaller
 * database — nothing to reset, and no way to leave a dangling reference to a table that is gone.

/**
 * Marks a Room `@Dao` as an accessor of THIS app's database.
 *
 * Emits BOTH the `abstract val` on the generated `AppDatabase` AND the Koin binding in
 * `GeneratedDaoBindings`. One annotation produces both because a DAO that exists on the database
 * but is never bound is invisible to injection, and a binding for an accessor that does not exist
 * does not compile — they cannot disagree when one declaration produces both.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @DbDao(accessor = "loanDao")
 * @Dao
 * interface LoanDao { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * @param accessor Property name on `AppDatabase`. Defaults to the interface name with a lowercase
 *                 first letter (`LoanDao` -> `loanDao`); set it only when that reads wrong.
