/**
 * JS (Kotlin/JS) factory for creating Room 3 database instances.
 *
 * Workers are bundled locally via webpack (no CDN dependency) using the
 * `sqlite-wasm-worker` npm package declared in core-base/database/build.gradle.kts.
 * webpack resolves `new URL("sqlite-wasm-worker/worker.js", import.meta.url)` at
 * build time and emits the worker + its WASM dependency as a separate bundle.
 *
 * [createDatabase] auto-detects the runtime environment:
 *  - crossOriginIsolated = true  (COOP/COEP headers — localhost dev) →
 *    WebWorkerSQLiteDriver + OPFS-backed persistent storage.
 *  - crossOriginIsolated = false (GitHub Pages / no headers) →
 *    Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder — data lives only for the current page session.
