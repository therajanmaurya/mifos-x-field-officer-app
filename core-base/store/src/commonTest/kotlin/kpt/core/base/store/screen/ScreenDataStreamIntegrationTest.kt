    // whose internal coroutines are not fully virtual-time-bound, so a heavily-loaded CI runner can
    // exceed Turbine's 3s default while the logic under test is perfectly correct — the
    // 2026-09-02 `offline_with_empty_store_emits_Empty_offlineFirst` failure on a runner executing
    // 3054 Gradle tasks, green on four prior runs of the identical code. Widening the wait budget
    // removes the scheduling flake WITHOUT relaxing a single assertion.
    //
    // Raised again 2026-09-05: 30s was still not enough under the Kover job, where coverage
    // INSTRUMENTATION multiplies the cost of every Store5 coroutine hop
    // (`reconnect_triggers_refresh_after_offline`, 3119 tasks). The tell was that the identical
    // commit passed `desktopTest` on all three Desktop runners and failed only under Kover.
    //
    // This budget exists to bound a genuine HANG, not to assert performance: a healthy run
    // satisfies it in milliseconds, so a generous ceiling costs nothing on success and still fails
    // loudly — with a real "no more events" diagnostic — if a state never arrives. [runTestTimeout]
    // sits above it so Turbine's diagnostic wins the race against runTest's bare timeout.
    //
    // 2026-09-10 — the budget was NOT the cause, and raising it a third time would not have helped.
    // `offline_with_empty_store_emits_Empty_offlineFirst` failed again under Kover, but the whole
    // `:core-base:store:desktopTest` task ran ~18s end to end: it asserted the WRONG STATE, it did
    // not time out. Root cause was in production code, not scheduling — DecisionEngine's
    // offline-first rule required `error == null`, while Store5's `cached(refresh = false)` DOES
    // invoke the fetcher when nothing is cached, so offline cold start reliably produced a
    // connection failure and the screen showed Empty or a blocking NoNetwork depending on which
    // emission won. Fixed in DecisionEngine.decideNoData and pinned deterministically by
    // DecisionEngineTest ("…NETWORK error + CACHE_FIRST_SWR = Empty — doomed fetch ignored").
    // Leave these budgets alone: they are a hang ceiling, and the next failure here is signal, not
    // a reason to widen them again.
