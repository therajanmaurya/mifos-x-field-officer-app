/**
 * Bundles the app-infra dependencies that [asScreenStream] needs — the [NetworkMonitor] and the
 * [FetchedAtRepository] — so a repository injects ONE screen-stream context instead of threading two
 * framework singletons through every read method. Homed here in `core-base/store` next to
 * [asScreenStream] and DI-provided once (a single).
 *
 * Note: with Koin constructor injection, one injected param is the floor — a repository can't reach
 * zero without a `KoinComponent` service-locator (an anti-pattern). This collapses the two scattered
 * infra params into one clearly-named context owned by `core-base/store`.
