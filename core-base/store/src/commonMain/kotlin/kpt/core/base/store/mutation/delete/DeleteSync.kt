/**
 * The network-DELETE-with-sync primitive Store5 lacks (its `Updater` is write-only).
 *
 * A delete clears the local row immediately — so it disappears from every read (Store stream AND Dao
 * reactive query on the same table) at once — then syncs the network DELETE. If the device is offline or
 * the DELETE fails, the key is recorded in the [Bookkeeper] as a pending delete and retried on reconnect
 * by the feature's `SyncOrchestrator` (the same drain that retries failed writes).
 *
 * Every dependency is a lambda / interface so this is exercised without a fake Store5 store.
 *
 * @param clearLocal    removes the local row (typically `store.clear(key)`).
 * @param deleteEndpoint the suspend network DELETE.
 * @param bookkeeper    records/clears the pending-delete tombstone for retry.
 * @param isOnline      connectivity probe.
 * @param now           monotonic millis provider (injected for deterministic tests).
