/**
 * Controls whether a screen stream reads from cache, hits the network, or both.
 *
 * Pass to [ScreenDataStream.asScreenStream], [LoadOnceStream.asLoadOnceStream], or
 * [PagingScreenStream] to override that entry point's default.
 *
 * **Defaults differ per entry point — there is no single global default:**
 * | Entry point                                             | Default              |
 * |---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
 * | `asScreenStream` (all overloads)                        | [CACHE_FIRST_SWR]    |
 * | `asLoadOnceStream`                                      | [NETWORK_WITH_CACHE] |
 * | [PagingScreenStream] / `asPagingScreenStream`           | [NETWORK_WITH_CACHE] |
 * | `StoreFactory.createScreenWithMutation`                 | [NETWORK_WITH_CACHE] |
 *
 * **Choosing a policy:**
 * | Scenario                                                                    | Policy                |
 * |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
 * | Offline-first screen — cached value now, revalidate only when stale         | [CACHE_FIRST_SWR]     |
 * | Show cached data immediately, always refresh in background                  | [NETWORK_WITH_CACHE]  |
 * | Always-fresh data required (e.g. payment confirmation)                      | [NETWORK_ONLY]        |
 * | Offline-only view or explicit "load from cache"                             | [CACHE_ONLY]          |
 * | Ambient surface that silently re-fetches on a cadence (FX rates, tickers)  | [PERIODIC]            |
 *
 * Modelled as a sealed interface so the vocabulary is open to additional variants
 * without breaking the source-compatible `FetchPolicy.NETWORK_WITH_CACHE`-style
 * access pattern.

     * [ScreenState.Empty].

     * **DataFreshness behaviour:** the stream emits [kpt.core.base.store.screen.DataFreshness.STALE]
     * when the cached data is older than the TTL. [DataFreshness.UPDATING] is never emitted
     * in CACHE_ONLY mode, so no refreshing banner shows. Feature screens handle stale presentation

    /**
     * Network-with-cache on the read side, plus a periodic background refresh.
     *
     * Use for ambient surfaces that should silently re-fetch on a cadence — live FX
     * rates, market tickers, dashboard tiles. The read semantic is identical to
     * [NETWORK_WITH_CACHE] (cached value emitted immediately, network refresh
     * layered in); the periodic refresh is fired by [ScreenDataStream] internally
     * via the same refresh-trigger pipeline as the reconnect refresh and the
     * user-tap refresh — so it goes through the user-tap debounce window, the
     * staleness banner, and the lastContent preservation logic for free.
     *
     * **Tuning notes:**
     * - [intervalMillis] must be positive. Values shorter than ~5s on mobile
     *   risk battery drain; values shorter than the
     *   [DEFAULT_USER_REFRESH_DEBOUNCE_MS] (1s) will be coalesced by the
     *   user-tap debounce anyway.
     * - [foregroundOnly] is wired as a flag today but the foreground-aware
     *   gating is deferred to a follow-up phase (needs `LocalAppForegroundFlow`
     *   threading through core-base/ui). The ticker fires unconditionally for
     *   now; the flag is parsed and held so callers can declare intent without
     *   waiting for the runtime gate.
     *
     * @property intervalMillis Refresh cadence in milliseconds. Must be `> 0`.
     * @property foregroundOnly If true (default), refresh only when the app is
     *   in the foreground. Currently informational — see "Tuning notes".
