/**
 * The single WRITE door for every mutation in the app.
 *
 * A repository never calls a `Dao` write directly; it routes upsert / delete / command through this
 * gateway, which reaches the network and write-throughs to the local source of truth (Room) so every
 * read — a Store stream OR a Dao reactive query on the same table — stays coherent.
 *
 * The gateway COMPOSES the existing Store5 write machinery (`MutableStore.write` + `Updater` +
 * `Bookkeeper`) and the command outbox; it does not replace them. Room remains the durable source of
 * truth; the gateway is the single write SoT on top of it.
 *
 * @see MutationPolicy for the two execution models (optimistic vs online-required).
 * @see MutationResult for the exhaustive outcome type — no mutation fails silently.
