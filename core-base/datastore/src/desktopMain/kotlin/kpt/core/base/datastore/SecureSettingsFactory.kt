/**
 * Desktop secure settings — every VALUE is AES-GCM encrypted at rest, with a one-time in-place
 * upgrade for stores written before encryption existed.
 *
 * This file previously claimed to be "an AES-encrypted properties file" while writing plain
 * `Properties`: the passcode and auth token sat in `~/.mifos-secure/secure_settings.properties` in
 * cleartext, under a type named `secureSettings`, with a KDoc asserting encryption that did not
 * exist. The claim was the dangerous part — a reader had no reason to look.
 *
 * Encryption reuses [FieldEncryptor] (AES-GCM, BouncyCastle) with the key from [SecureKeyProvider],
 * rather than a second crypto path. VALUES are encrypted; KEY NAMES stay clear so the file stays
 * debuggable and `PropertiesSettings` can index it.
 *
 * ## Why the prefix
 * Ciphertext here is Base64 and legacy cleartext is arbitrary JSON, so "did this decrypt?" cannot
 * distinguish a pre-encryption value from a corrupt one — an earlier cut of this class dropped both,
 * which silently signed every existing desktop user out. [ENC_PREFIX] makes the format
 * self-describing: prefixed means ciphertext (a decrypt failure is then genuinely corrupt or a
 * rotated key, and dropping it is right), unprefixed means legacy cleartext, which is read as-is and
 * re-encrypted. No secret is lost and no guess is made.
 *
 * The upgrade is eager: if any legacy value is present the whole file is rewritten encrypted on
 * first load, so the cleartext window is one launch rather than "until that preference is next
 * written". The rewrite goes through a temp file and an atomic move, because it is rewriting the
 * only copy of the user's secrets and a crash mid-write would destroy them.
 *
 * ## Threat model — read this before relying on it
 * The key lives in `~/.mifos-secure/field_key.bin`, protected by filesystem permissions alone. This
 * defends against casual disclosure — backups, sync folders, support bundles — and NOT against an
 * attacker who can already read arbitrary files as this user, since they can read the key too.
 * Genuine protection needs the OS credential store (macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret / Windows
 * DPAPI), which is the deferred Phase 4 (T18) work. A real limitation, stated rather than implied.
