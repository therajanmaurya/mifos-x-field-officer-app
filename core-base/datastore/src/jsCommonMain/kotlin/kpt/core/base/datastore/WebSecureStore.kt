/**
 * Process-wide backing store for web secure settings.
 *
 * ## Why the state is process-wide rather than per-instance
 * `SecureSettingsFactory.create()` is SYNCHRONOUS (it is the same `expect` every platform
 * implements) while WebCrypto is async-only. The bridge is to do the async work ONCE at startup —
 * [warmUp] — and let `create()` hand out a synchronous view over the already-decrypted cache. Koin
 * builds `Settings` lazily and long after boot, so the warmed state has to outlive any one factory.
 *
 * ## Reads are synchronous, writes are asynchronous
 * Reads hit the in-memory cache. Writes update the cache immediately (so a read-after-write is
 * always correct) and schedule a debounced encrypt-and-persist. A tab closed within
 * [FLUSH_DEBOUNCE_MS] of a write can lose that last write — a real, bounded limitation, and the
 * cost of putting a synchronous interface over an asynchronous crypto API.
 *
 * The behaviour itself lives in [SecureStoreCore] so it can be tested without a browser.
