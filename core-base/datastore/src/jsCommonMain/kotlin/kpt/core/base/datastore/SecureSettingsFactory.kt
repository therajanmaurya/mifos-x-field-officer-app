/**
 * Web secure settings — AES-GCM via WebCrypto under a **non-extractable** key in IndexedDB.
 *
 * This previously returned a bare `StorageSettings()`: the passcode and auth state sat in
 * localStorage as readable JSON, one DevTools panel away, while the `expect` KDoc described web as
 * "in-memory" — which would at least have died with the tab.
 *
 * ## Call [warmUp] before Koin
 * `create()` is synchronous because every other platform's is, but WebCrypto is async-only. So the
 * async work happens once at startup and `create()` returns a synchronous view over the result.
 * If warm-up has not completed, `create()` THROWS rather than quietly handing back an empty or
 * plaintext store — a silent fallback is how the original defect stayed invisible.
 *
 * ## Bounds worth knowing
 * The key is non-extractable, so no script can export it — not even injected script, which is
 * limited to using it on the live page instead of taking it away. That is a real improvement over
 * plaintext and not a claim of XSS immunity; no browser storage scheme offers that.
