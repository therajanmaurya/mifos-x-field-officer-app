/**
 * Keeps [RuntimeHeaderStore] in step with the stored credential, so `Authorization` is automatic.
 *
 * ## Why a bridge rather than reading the store per request
 * Header resolution is SYNCHRONOUS — it runs inside Ktor's `defaultRequest`, which cannot suspend —
 * while the credential lives in a suspending, persistent store. Bridging inverts the problem: the
 * durable store stays the source of truth, this collects its changes once, and the hot path reads an
 * in-memory map. A token restored from disk at startup lands before the first request; one obtained
 * at login lands the moment it is written.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 * It never invents a value. Only points that DECLARE an `auth:` scheme are bridged, each in its own
 * scheme's wire format, so a public endpoint is never handed a credential it did not ask for.
 *
 * ## Manual control is preserved
 * The bridge writes the same [RuntimeHeaderStore] a fork can write directly. Anything not declared —
 * a signed request, a per-tenant key, a scheme this enum does not model — is still just
 * `runtimeHeaders["<id>.auth"] = "…"`, and a fork that wants to TRANSFORM the stored token (wrap it,
 * exchange it, add a prefix) can bind its own [AuthTokenSource] that maps the flow.
