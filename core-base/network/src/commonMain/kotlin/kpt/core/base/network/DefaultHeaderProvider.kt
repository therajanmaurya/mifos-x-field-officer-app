/**
 * Headers this app sends on EVERY request, resolved per access point.
 *
 * `setupDefaultHttpClient` has always accepted `defaultHeaders`, but nothing reached it: the REST
 * clients are all built by [AccessPointRegistry.ktorfitFor], which passed only the base URL and the
 * loggable/proxied hosts. A fork that needed an `X-Api-Key` or an `X-Client-Version` on every call
 * had no way to supply one short of hand-building its own Ktorfit and giving up the generated
 * bindings. This is the seam that closes it.
 *
 * ## Per access point, not global
 * [headersFor] takes the access-point id because a header is almost never app-wide: a key belongs to
 * ONE endpoint, and sending it to the others leaks a credential to hosts that never needed it.
 * Returning the same map for every id is a deliberate choice a fork can still make; the reverse —
 * scoping a global map back down — is not expressible.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * object ProjectNetworkHeaders : DefaultHeaderProvider {
 *     override fun headersFor(accessPointId: String): Map<String, String> = when (accessPointId) {
 *         "main" -> mapOf("X-Client-Version" to BuildKonfig.VERSION_NAME)
 *         else -> emptyMap()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## What does NOT belong here
 * `Authorization`. Bearer/Basic/Digest go through `setupDefaultHttpClient`'s `authProviders`, which
 * installs Ktor's `Auth` plugin and can refresh a token; a header pinned here is captured once at
 * client construction and never refreshes. It would work until the token expired.
 *
 * A per-REQUEST value (a request id, a trace span) does not belong here either — this map is read
 * once per client, not once per call. Use a Ktor plugin for that.
 *
 * Bound in `NetworkModule`; a fork overrides it by binding its own implementation. Resolved
 * optionally, so a fork that never binds one gets the empty default and no behaviour change.
