/**
 * Asks the OS for a specific system screen or document flow, and reports what came back.
 *
 * ## Scope — system intents ONLY
 * This interface used to also carry `launchUri` and the `share*` family, which conflated three
 * different acts. They now live on [kpt.core.base.platform.url.UrlLauncher] and
 * [kpt.core.base.platform.share.ShareManager]. What is left here is the case neither of those
 * covers: handing control to the OS and getting an [IntentResult] back.
 *
 * Every method returns an [IntentResult] rather than Unit, because a system flow can be cancelled
 * by the user and the caller usually has to react to that.
