/**
 * Hands content to the platform share chooser.
 *
 * ## Why this is not part of `IntentManager` or `UrlLauncher`
 * Sharing RAISES A CHOOSER and gives the content to another app; opening a URL sends the user
 * straight to a handler; a system intent asks the OS for a specific screen or document. Three
 * different outcomes, so three interfaces — a caller that wants one of them cannot accidentally
 * reach for another.
 *
 * Every method suspends because the share sheet is presented and awaited on most targets.
