/**
 * In-app update check, with real behaviour on every target.
 *
 * ## Why this is one commonMain contract now
 * This used to be a per-target pair: a Play Core implementation in `androidMain` and a twin in
 * `nonAndroidMain` whose two methods were empty bodies. iOS, desktop and web therefore had no
 * update path at all, and no caller could tell — the calls compiled and silently did nothing.
 *
 * [AppUpdateManagerImpl] now delegates to the toolkit's `AppUpdate` engine, which ships real
 * `actual`s for 11 targets, so one implementation is honest on all of them. A target the engine
 * genuinely cannot serve says so through [UpdateOutcome.NotSupported] rather than by doing nothing.
 *
 * ## Why these suspend
 * The check is a network call on every target. The former signature was fire-and-forget, which is
 * exactly what let a no-op twin pass for a working implementation.
