/**
 * Provides every platform manager to composition.
 *
 * This was an `expect fun` with androidMain and nonAndroidMain actuals. The two bodies differed in
 * exactly one line — Android constructed `AppReviewManagerImpl(activity)` because Play Core's
 * review flow needed an `Activity`. `cmp-app-review` removed that requirement, so the bodies became
 * identical and the split had nothing left to express.
 *
 * Every manager is resolved from `platformModule` rather than constructed here: constructing again
 * would hand composition a different instance from the one a ViewModel injects. That matters most
 * for the toast queue, where a second `ToastHostState` would mean the host renders nothing a
 * ViewModel raised.
 *
 * Place this once, near the root of the UI — `cmp-shared`'s `SharedApp` is where the template does
 * it. Everything below can then read any manager with `LocalShareManager.current` and friends.
 *
 * @param context retained for call-site compatibility with forks. Nothing here needs it now that no
 *   manager is Activity-bound; `AppContext` itself remains the expect/actual that backs
 *   [kpt.core.base.platform.context.LocalContext].

/*
 * Name collision with the toolkit's -compose modules — read before adding an import.
 *
 * cmp-share-compose, cmp-intent-launcher-compose and cmp-app-intents-compose each export their own
 * `LocalShareManager` / `LocalIntentManager` / `LocalAppIntentsManager`, the same simple names used
 * here.
 *
 * None of them throws when unprovided. Each defaults to `staticCompositionLocalOf { SomeImpl() }`,
 * so a wrong import compiles, runs, and quietly uses a SECOND manager — no error to notice. That is
 * why `LocalManagerProvider` above provides all three too, from the same Koin graph: whichever name
 * is imported now resolves to the app's instance.
 *
 * Share and intent-launcher are the real duplicates, because the template's managers are wrappers —
 * `ShareManager` adds MimeType handling and ImageBitmap encoding; `IntentManager` exposes only the
 * SystemIntents-backed operations (openAppSettings, createDocument) that need no Activity. The
 * toolkit's own types carry the full operation sets. Both sides delegate to the same engines, so
 * they cannot disagree; pick the template's for the extras, the toolkit's for the full surface.
 *
 * App-intents had no such difference — both names meant the identical type — so the template's
 * duplicate was removed and the toolkit's is the single one.
 *
 * ## Android + intent pickers
 * The toolkit's `IntentManager` bound in `platformModule` has no `IntentLauncher` on Android,
 * because one is Activity-scoped. That is documented, honest degradation: the pickers report
 * unsupported and `rememberIntentCapabilities()` says so, while openAppSettings/createDocument still
 * work. A fork that wants pickers builds one from its Activity and overrides the local:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // inside setContent { } of a ComponentActivity
 * ProvideIntentManager(rememberIntentManagerFromLauncher()) { App() }
 * ```
 *//**
 * Builds a manager [ProvidableCompositionLocal] that throws, rather than defaulting, when read
 * without a provider above it.
 *
 * **Why throw.** There is no sensible fallback for any of these. A no-op default would let a share,
 * a review prompt or a PDF export silently do nothing — the exact failure mode this module just
 * removed from `AppReviewManager`, whose non-Android implementation was an empty method body. A
 * missing value here always means a wiring mistake, and it should be loud at the first read.
 *
 * **Why a factory.** The nine messages used to be written by hand and had drifted: two named the
 * CompositionLocal (`LocalIntentManager`), three named the type (`AppReviewManager`). Building them
 * from one place makes the wording structural instead of a convention each new local has to
 * remember, and the message can then afford to say how to fix the problem.
 *
 * @param name the local's own identifier — the thing you would grep for after seeing the exception,
 *   which is why the message names it rather than the manager type.
