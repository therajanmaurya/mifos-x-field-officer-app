/**
 * Manages application review requests across platforms.
 *
 * This interface abstracts the platform-specific implementations for requesting
 * user reviews of the application. It provides methods to prompt users for app
 * reviews using either standard system-provided flows or custom-designed review
 * experiences.
 *
 * Platform-specific implementations of this interface typically integrate with:
 * - Google Play In-App Review API on Android
 * - StoreKit Review Controller on iOS
 * - Other platform-specific review mechanisms
 *
 * Review requests should be triggered at appropriate moments in the user journey
 * when the user has completed a meaningful interaction with the application and
 * is likely to have a positive experience to report.

     * is precisely what the previous non-Android implementation shipped.

     * returns a task, and the previous non-suspend signature could only be honoured by ignoring
     * the result. Call it from `rememberCoroutineScope().launch { }` in composition.
