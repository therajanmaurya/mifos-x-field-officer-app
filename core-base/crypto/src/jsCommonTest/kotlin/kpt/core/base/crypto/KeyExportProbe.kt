/**
 * Reads the persisted `CryptoKey` straight out of IndexedDB and attempts `crypto.subtle.exportKey`
 * on it, returning whether the export SUCCEEDED.
 *
 * This is the probe for the one property that makes web storage worth encrypting at all: the key is
 * generated with `extractable: false`, so no script — including injected script — can export its raw
 * bytes and use them offline. Asserting that from outside [WebSecureCrypto], against the real stored
 * key rather than the object the class happens to hold, is what makes it a test of the guarantee and
 * not of our own bookkeeping.
 *
 * Returns false when no key is stored yet.
