/*
 * Cryptographic primitives, deliberately free of Compose.
 *
 * These used to live in `core-base/security`, which applies the Compose plugin for its two UI
 * pieces (SecurityGate, SecurityState). That made every consumer of a crypto primitive — including
 * `core-base/datastore` and `core/database`, which have no UI — drag in the whole Compose graph:
 *
 *     core-base:datastore -> core-base:security -> compose.foundation
 *                         -> animation -> ui -> ui-graphics -> skiko
 *
 * Besides bloating web bundles, that is why the build convention had to disable three of the four
 * web test tasks for every non-Compose module: their wasm bundles referenced `skiko.mjs` and never
 * shipped it, so `wasmJsNodeTest` failed with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND. Splitting the primitives out
 * removes the edge rather than working around its symptom.
 *
 * Keep this module Compose-free. Anything needing @Composable belongs in `core-base/security`.

 * Route this module's web tests to a real browser.
 *
 * The build convention picks the web test environment by asking "does this module apply Compose?",
 * using that as a proxy for "does it need a DOM". This module needs a browser for a DIFFERENT
 * reason: `WebSecureCrypto` calls WebCrypto (`crypto.subtle`) and persists its key in IndexedDB,
 * and Node provides neither — under the default routing `WebSecureCryptoTest` fails 9 of 10.
 *
 * Testing the real thing is the entire point of that suite (a fake cipher would prove nothing about
 * whether the key is genuinely non-extractable), so the browser tasks are turned on and the node
 * ones off. The platform-agnostic store logic that CAN run anywhere lives in `core-base/datastore`
 * and is tested on desktop, iOS, JS and wasm.
