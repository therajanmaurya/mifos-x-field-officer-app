# deployment/_shared/before_all.rb — regenerate the derived store listing before ANY lane.
#
# app-profile/ (app.yaml + platforms/<p>/*.yaml + platforms/<p>/media) is the SINGLE source of truth
# for all store-listing text + media. deployment/**/metadata is DERIVED (customization-surface
# owner:generated, gitignored) — fastlane's `metadata_path` reads that dir, so it MUST be materialized
# from app-profile via `./gradlew syncForkConfig` BEFORE deliver/supply run, or a fresh clone / CI
# deploy would upload EMPTY listings.
#
# Imported by BOTH deployment/Fastfile (CI entry) and deployment/fastlane/Fastfile (local) so it runs
# whichever Fastfile fastlane loads. Runs once per invocation (SYNC_FORK_DONE latch — /idea-deploy
# STEP 1.7.0 already sets it when it pre-syncs). Fail-soft: a gradle hiccup never blocks a deploy.
# Files fastlane's match / gym / version steps write back into the TRACKED source tree during a build:
# the resolved signing identity into cmp-ios project.pbxproj (PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER +
# PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER = "match AppStore <id>") and the computed version into Info.plist.
# Committing those RE-HARDCODES the template bundle id into every fork's Xcode project
# (breaking white-label) and trips scripts/product-health/checks/ios-pbxproj-identity.sh. A deploy must
# NEVER dirty tracked source, so restore this allow-list to its committed state after every lane
# (success AND error) — the deploy already built/uploaded from the mutated files; we just clean the
# tree so `git add -A` (git-session-commit) can't sweep the writeback in. (2026-08-09.)

  # installed for .ruby-version. The result is a crash inside rubygems' `activate_bin_path` that
  # reads as a GEM problem — the gems are fine, the interpreter is wrong.

  # Shell scripts avoid this by going through scripts/ruby-exec.sh (RT-9 enforces it). But the READMEs
  # and each target's config.yaml `local:` command DOCUMENT a bare `bundle exec fastlane …` for a
  # human to copy — correct guidance for a correctly-configured shell, and nothing a lint can fix.
  # This is the one place every lane passes through, so it is where that human gets told the truth
