/**
 * Fineract authentication.
 *
 * `POST /authentication` previously lived on `ClientService` and was reached through
 * `DataManagerAuth` — an auth endpoint hanging off the client RESOURCE api, which is why the
 * `auth` context had DTOs but no API of its own. It belongs here: the credential exchange is not
 * a client operation, and the response seeds the Authorization header every other api then sends.
 *
 * The response carries the token; `app-profile` declares `auth: basic` on the `mifos` access point
 * with `Authorization` as a runtime header, so the login flow writes it to the runtime store and
 * the transport attaches it from there.
