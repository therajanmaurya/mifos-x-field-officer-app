/**
 * THE FORK'S network DI seam. Empty on the neutral template — this is yours to fill.
 *
 * It lives outside any per-endpoint package on purpose, so `scripts/remove-demo.sh` leaves it
 * standing: a fork that runs the customizer (which strips the demo BY DEFAULT — "forking = starting
 * clean") keeps this file and can wire network DI immediately.
 *
 * There is no `DemoNetworkModule` any more. Endpoint code now lives in a package named for its
 * ACCESS POINT (`kpt.core.network.<id>.api` / `.dto` / `.config`), generated per declared endpoint,
 * so the demo's API types are deleted with their access points rather than with a `demo/` package.
 * What is left over is DI — and DI for a non-derivable single belongs here, demo-fenced.
 *
 * ## What does NOT go here
 * API client bindings. Every server is declared once in `app-profile/app.yaml#network.access_points`
 * and its Koin binding is GENERATED into [GeneratedApiBindings], which [NetworkModule] includes.
 * Adding a `restApi(...)`/`supabaseApi(...)` line here is refused by
 * `scripts/product-health/checks/network-access-points.sh` (NAP-7).
 *
 * ## What DOES go here
 * Network singles that cannot be derived from an endpoint declaration — request-time API-key configs,
 * interceptor/auth providers, custom serializers. Example:
 * ```
 * single<MyApiConfig> { MyApiConfig(apiKey = BuildKonfig.MY_API_KEY.takeIf { it.isNotBlank() }) }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Supabase modules beyond Postgrest — [SupabaseExtrasProvider]
 * [SupabaseConfigClient] installs Postgrest and nothing else; Auth / ComposeAuth / Realtime / Storage
 * are opt-in. Bind the seam HERE — it is the one place a fork can install them without either editing
 * template code (deleted on the next sync) or building a second `createSupabaseClient`:
 * ```
 * single<SupabaseExtrasProvider> {
 *     SupabaseExtrasProvider { id ->
 *         when (id) {
 *             "<your-project-ref>" -> {
 *                 {
 *                     install(Auth) { /* scheme/host for the OAuth redirect */ }
 *                     install(ComposeAuth) { /* native Google/Apple sign-in */ }
 *                 }
 *             }
 *             // Several projects sharing a module — one branch, no repetition.
 *             "<project-b>", "<project-c>" -> {
 *                 { install(Realtime) }
 *             }
 *             else -> {
 *                 {}
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * A SECOND CLIENT IS THE BUG THIS PREVENTS: sign in on your own `createSupabaseClient` and the
 * generated `supabaseApi(...)` binding hands `@ApiBinding` types a DIFFERENT instance carrying no
 * session, so every RLS-gated call resolves no `auth.uid()` — compiling cleanly the whole way. The
 * binding is optional; bind nothing and you get Postgrest only.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS `owner: fork`. `/kmp-project-template-sync` preserves it — the template ships it empty
 * and never overwrites what you add. That is why the seam is bound here and not in the template-owned
 * [NetworkModule], which the sync full-copies.

    // BOUND, not merely documented. SupabaseClientFactory resolves this with `getOrNull`, so an
    // absent binding and a binding that returns `{}` behave identically — but a live binding puts the
    // extension point in CODE, where a fork editing this file will see it, instead of in a KDoc it
    // has to know to read. The template itself needs nothing beyond Postgrest, so every branch is
    // `{}` until a fork adds its own.
    //
    // `when`, not `if (id != X)`: the negated-if shape reads as "one project, everything else is a
    // no-op" and stops scaling the moment a second project appears. A `when` takes N branches and a
    // comma-separated branch for modules several projects share, with `else -> {}` as the explicit
    // "this point needs nothing extra".
