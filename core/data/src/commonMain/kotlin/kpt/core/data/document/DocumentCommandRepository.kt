 * Every document write, as an explicit outcome.
 *
 * Each returns [MutationResult] rather than `Unit`: a field officer has to be told whether the
 * change reached the server, was refused because the device is offline, or failed — a distinction
 * that cannot be reconstructed above this layer.
 *
 * These are commands, so they carry no Store and no cache. Offline CAPTURE is a different
 * operation with its own explicit queue ([kpt.core.data.sync.OfflineQueueRepository]); it is never
 * a silent fallback from here.
