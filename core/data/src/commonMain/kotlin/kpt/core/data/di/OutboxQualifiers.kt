/**
 * Named qualifiers for the app's `SubmitOutbox<*>` bindings.
 *
 * Why qualifiers?
 *
 * Koin indexes `single<T>` definitions by `T::class` (the raw type), not by the full
 * `KType`. So `single<SubmitOutbox<Loan>>` and `single<SubmitOutbox<PriceAlert>>` both
 * collide under `SubmitOutbox::class` — the LAST registered wins. Every consumer that
 * calls `get<SubmitOutbox<Foo>>()` actually receives whichever outbox was registered last,
 * regardless of the generic parameter. At first `.saveByUniqueKey(payload)` call, the
 * wrong serializer fires:
 *
 *   `ClassCastException: ...LoanCalcScenario cannot be cast to ...PriceAlert`
 *
 * Fix: every outbox `single<>` registration declares `qualifier = OutboxQualifiers.X`
 * and every consumer uses `get(qualifier = OutboxQualifiers.X)`. Then the lookup keys
 * are unambiguous: `(SubmitOutbox::class, "outbox.loan")` ≠
 * `(SubmitOutbox::class, "outbox.priceAlert")`.
 *
 * Add a new payload type? Add a new constant here, register its `single<>` with the
 * qualifier, and have the consuming feature module fetch with the same qualifier:
 * ```
 * val MyThing = named("outbox.myThing")
 * ```
 *
 * Intentionally EMPTY on the template (E1/C4). The demo showcase's qualifiers live in the
 * generated [kpt.core.data.config.AppOutboxQualifiers], derived from `@DataProvider(qualifier = …)`,
 * deletes them with the rest of the showcase and a template sync can blind-copy THIS file
 * without re-introducing them.
