 * THE FORK'S repository DI seam. Empty on the neutral template — this is yours to fill.
 *
 * It lives outside `demo/` on purpose, so `scripts/remove-demo.sh` leaves it standing: a fork that
 * runs the customizer (which strips the demo BY DEFAULT — "forking = starting clean") keeps this file
 * and can wire DI immediately. Its demo counterpart is deleted by that same strip.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * single<MyRepository> { MyRepositoryImpl(get(), get()) }
 * ```
