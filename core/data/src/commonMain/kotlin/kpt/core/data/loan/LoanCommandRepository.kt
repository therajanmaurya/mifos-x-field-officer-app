/**
 * Every loan write, as an explicit outcome.
 *
 * Each returns [MutationResult] rather than `Unit` — a field officer has to be told whether an
 * approval reached the server, was refused because the device is offline, or failed outright, and
 * that distinction cannot be reconstructed above this layer.
 *
 * ## Policy is per method, not per repository
 *
 * Anything that moves money or changes a loan's legal state — approve, reject, disburse, repay,
 * charge-off, reschedule, officer reassignment — is [OnlineRequired][kpt.core.base.store.mutation.MutationPolicy.OnlineRequired]:
 * it awaits the server and writes NOTHING offline, surfacing `Blocked(OFFLINE)` instead. An
 * optimistic approval is a lie the officer would act on — telling them a loan is approved when the
 * server never saw it is worse than telling them to find signal.
 *
 * Offline CAPTURE of a repayment is a different operation and lives on
 * [kpt.core.data.sync.OfflineQueueRepository]: it queues the intent locally and is explicit that
 * nothing has been sent. [submitPayment] here is the online, immediate path.
 *
 * Commands take the API's request DTO rather than a parallel domain type. A command payload has no
 * cached domain form — it exists only to be sent — so a second shape would be a copy with nothing
 * to keep it honest.
