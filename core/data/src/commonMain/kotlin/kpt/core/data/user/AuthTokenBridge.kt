/**
 * Binds the network's [AuthTokenSource] port to where the credential actually lives.
 *
 * `core-base/network` must not depend on `core/datastore` — that would invert the module graph — so
 * it declares the port and `core/data`, which already depends on both, supplies it. Same shape as
 * `UserDataSource`, which bridges `core/store` to the same preferences.
 *
 * Every access point sees the SAME token today. That is deliberate rather than incidental: a fork
 * needing per-endpoint credentials overrides this binding with its own [AuthTokenSource] and keys off
 * `accessPointId` — the parameter exists precisely so that is a substitution, not a rewrite.
