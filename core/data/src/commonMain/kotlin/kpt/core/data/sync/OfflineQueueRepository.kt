/**
 * Work captured with no connectivity, and the queue the sync screen drains.
 *
 * Enqueue is `MutationPolicy.Optimistic` by construction — capture happens against Room and MUST
 * succeed offline, which is the entire point of the app. The network leg is a separate, explicit
 * sync of these queues, so the officer can tell "saved" from "sent"; nothing here silently posts.
 *
 * Every enqueue returns [MutationResult] rather than Unit: the caller has to be able to say whether
 * the row landed, and a `Failed` here means the capture itself was lost — the one outcome a field
 * officer must never be left guessing about.
