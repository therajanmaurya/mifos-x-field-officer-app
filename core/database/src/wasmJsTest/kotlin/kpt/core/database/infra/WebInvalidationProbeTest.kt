/**
 * Does Room's own `InvalidationTracker` re-emit a DAO `Flow` after writes on the single-threaded
 * web event loop? That question decides whether the invalidation bridge
 * (`core-base/database/.../invalidation`) is load-bearing, so it is answered by measurement here
 * rather than asserted in prose.
 *
 * ## Why none of this uses `runTest` virtual time or turbine
 *
 * It MUST NOT. Under `runTest` the scheduler runs on virtual time, and `awaitItem()` waiting on a
 * value that can only arrive from a REAL web-worker round trip spins the single JS thread: the
 * browser stops answering Karma's pings and is dropped with
 * "Disconnected (0 times) reconnect failed before timeout of 2000ms (ping timeout)".
 *
 * That failure looks exactly like "Room lost the invalidation" and is not — it is the harness
 * blocking the very event loop the driver needs. It cost one wrong conclusion already (a bug was
 * attributed to Room that a real-time measurement then disproved), so every wait below is real
 * time on [Dispatchers.Default] and every collection is a plain `launch` + list.
 *
 * Only runnable where a browser `Worker` exists — `jsBrowserTest`/`wasmJsBrowserTest`, never the
 * node tasks (the module's build script excludes it there).
