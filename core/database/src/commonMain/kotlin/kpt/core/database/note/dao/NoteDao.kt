/**
 * Notes attached to a client (or other Fineract resource).
 *
 * `NoteEntity` shipped without a DAO, so notes had no read path out of Room and the feature was
 * network-only. Scoped by `clientId` because that is how the wire endpoint is scoped
 * (`{resourceType}/{resourceId}/notes`) — a global read would mix one client's notes into another's.
