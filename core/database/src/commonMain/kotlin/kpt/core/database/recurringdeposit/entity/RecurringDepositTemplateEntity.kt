/**
 * The recurring-deposit account-opening TEMPLATE, cached per client.
 *
 * `RecurringDepositAccountTemplate` is a form-options payload — ~20 nested objects
 * (`accountChart`, `chargeOptions`, `fieldOfficerOptions`, the interest/period enums…). It is
 * fetched whole and rendered whole; nothing ever queries an individual column. Decomposing it
 * into relational tables would buy no query capability and cost a large migration surface, so it
 * is stored as one serialized snapshot keyed by client — the same JSON-through-a-converter
 * approach this database already uses for nested lists.
 *
 * Caching it is what lets a field officer OPEN the account-creation form with the right product
 * and officer options while offline; the account creation itself is a write and stays online (D1).
