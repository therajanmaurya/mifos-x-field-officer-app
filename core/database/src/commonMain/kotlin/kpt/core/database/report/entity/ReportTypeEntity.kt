/**
 * A runnable report definition (the CATALOGUE, not a result set).
 *
 * Definitions are slow-changing server reference data, so caching them lets a field officer browse
 * available reports offline. RUNNING a report stays online — its output is a live query against
 * Fineract, and a stale result is worse than no result.
 *
 * Keyed by `reportId`; `parameterId` is part of the row rather than the key because one report
 * has many parameters, which is also why the category index exists.
