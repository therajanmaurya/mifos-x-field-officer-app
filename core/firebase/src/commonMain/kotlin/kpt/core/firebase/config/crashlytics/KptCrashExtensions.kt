/**
 * CROSS-CUTTING [CrashReporter] breadcrumbs — TEMPLATE-OWNED, full-copied by every sync.
 *
 * The extension half of [KptCrashKeys]: it sets those keys and nothing else, so the vocabulary and
 * the calls that write it stay reviewable apart. Extensions rather than a wrapper class because the
 * callers already hold a [CrashReporter] — a navigation observer, a Ktor plugin, a sync worker.
 *
 * ## Feature breadcrumbs go in the feature's package
 * `kpt/core/firebase/<feature>/` holds them (see `loans/`), fork-owned in a fork. Nothing here
 * may name a feature, and no key set here may carry a value the user typed, an amount, or an
 * identifier that resolves to a person — a crash report travels further than an analytics event.
