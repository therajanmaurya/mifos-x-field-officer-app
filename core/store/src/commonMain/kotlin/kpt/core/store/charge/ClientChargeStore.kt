/**
 * Client charges — READ-CACHE (`createStore`), keyed by clientId.
 *
 * Keyed because both sides are client-scoped (`getListOfClientCharges(resourceType, resourceId)`
 * on the wire, `getClientCharges(clientId)` in Room). A `Unit` key would collapse every client's
 * charges into one slot and serve the previously-viewed client's rows — the Store5
 * `inconsistent-read-paths` anti-pattern.
 *
 * `resourceType` is pinned to "clients": the endpoint is shared with loans/savings, but this store
 * is the CLIENT charge read. A loan-charge store would be its own provider with its own key.
