 * The read PORT for the user-preferences store.

 * The preferences themselves live in `core/datastore`, which `core/store` does not depend on
 * (and must not — `core/datastore` sits beside it in the layer order, not below). The store
 * therefore declares the read seam and the DI site in `core/data`, which already owns
 * `UserDataRepositoryImpl` and its `UserPreferencesRepository`, supplies it.

/**
 * OFFLINE_LOCAL_ONLY Store5 store over user preferences
 * (`feature_profile.combo_id: local_only_prefs`).
 *
 * There is no network, so `createOfflineStore` streams purely from the source of truth — here
 * the multiplatform-settings-backed preferences flow rather than a Room DAO. Wrapping prefs in
 * a Store is what puts the settings screen on the same `ScreenState` read path as every other
 * screen: it gets Loading / Content / Error for free instead of the settings ViewModel
 * hand-rolling its own `SettingsUiState.Loading` sentinel.
 *
 * The source of truth is READ-ONLY here: preference WRITES keep flowing through
 * `UserDataRepository`'s existing typed setters (`setThemeBrand`, `setLanguage`, …), which
 * write to the preferences store and cause [UserDataSource.observe] to re-emit. Routing writes
 * through `store.write` instead would mean funnelling every individual typed setting through a
 * single whole-`UserData` blob write, losing the per-setting API for no benefit — so the writer
 * is deliberately not part of this store's contract.
