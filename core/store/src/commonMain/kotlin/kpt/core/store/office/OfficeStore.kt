/**
 * Offices — READ-CACHE archetype (`createStore`).
 *
 * The first vertical of the DataManager→Store5 collapse. It replaces the
 * `Repository → DataManagerOffice → { OfficeApi , OfficeDaoHelper }` chain, in which the
 * Room branch was commented out and every read went to the network — so this store is not a
 * re-wrapping of the old path, it is the offline-first read that path intended.
 *
 * `fetcher` is the Ktorfit service; `sourceOfTruth` is the Room DAO, so a field officer with no
 * connectivity still renders the office list from cache and a reconnect refreshes it. Offices are
 * reference data — server-authoritative, low-churn, read-only on the device — which is exactly
 * the read-cache shape rather than a ledger (no delta/paging) or a mutable store (no local writes).
