/**
 * Fork implementation of [ProjectPreferencesRepository]. `owner: fork` — never synced.
 *
 * `by delegate` forwards every framework preference to the template's own implementation, so this
 * class starts out complete and STAYS complete when the template ADDS a preference: the new member
 * arrives on the supertype and the delegate already satisfies it. No edit here, no compile break.
 *
 * It also receives the same storage handles the template's impl gets — [plainSettings],
 * [secureSettings] and [dispatcher] — because delegation alone gives you READ access to framework
 * preferences and nowhere to put your OWN. A fork needs somewhere to write.
 *
 * They are public `val`s, mirroring [UserPreferencesRepositoryImpl]: the whole point of this class is
 * that a fork fills it in, so the handles it is handed should be reachable rather than sealed off in
 * a class the fork owns anyway. It also means the compiler does not warn about unused private
 * members while the body is still empty.
 *
 * ## Add a preference
 * Declare it on [ProjectPreferencesRepository], then implement it here against the settings:
 * ```
 * override val observeMyFlag: Flow<Boolean> =
 *     MutableStateFlow(plainSettings.getBoolean(KEY_MY_FLAG, false))
 *
 * override suspend fun setMyFlag(enabled: Boolean) = withContext(dispatcher.io) {
 *     plainSettings.putBoolean(KEY_MY_FLAG, enabled)
 * }
 * ```
 * Use [secureSettings] for anything sensitive — it is encrypted at rest on every platform that can
 * be (Android EncryptedSharedPreferences, iOS/native Keychain, desktop AES-GCM). Web is browser
 * storage and is NOT encrypted; do not put a credential there.
 *
 * Namespace your keys (e.g. a `project.` prefix) so a future framework preference cannot collide
 * with yours on the shared `Settings` instances.
 *
 * ## Alter a framework preference
 * `override` it — the explicit member wins over the delegated one, and `delegate.…` still reaches
 * the framework behaviour underneath:
 * ```
 * override suspend fun setDarkThemeConfig(darkThemeConfig: DarkThemeConfig) {
 *     analytics.log("theme_changed")
 *     delegate.setDarkThemeConfig(darkThemeConfig)
 * }
 * ```
