 * The fork's preference surface: everything the framework has no concept of.
 *
 * Inheritance is the contract — a framework preference cannot be dropped without a compile error,
 * and anything declared here is additive. What belongs here is only what is Fineract-specific:
 * WHICH server this install talks to, and WHO is signed in to it. Theme, language, passcode,
 * onboarding and the auth-token slot already exist on [UserPreferencesRepository] and must be used
 * from there rather than re-declared — the fork's old datastore carried its own parallel copies of
 * all four, which is how they drifted.
