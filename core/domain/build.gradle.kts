// ── Fork-owned dependency seam (white-label, mirrors `feature-deps.gradle.kts`) ────────────────
// A fork adds its OWN dependencies for this module in `core/domain/module-deps.gradle.kts` — never in
// this file. That is what lets THIS build file be `owner: template` and FULL-COPY on a template
// sync: the fork's deps live in a file the sync never touches, so a template plugin/version bump
// can no longer drop them and no 3-way merge is needed.
//
// String `"commonMainImplementation"(...)` notation is used in the seam, not the type-safe
// `libs.`/`projects.` accessors: those are NOT generated for `apply(from = ...)` script plugins.
//
// Guarded like feature-deps: a fork that adopted the template BEFORE this seam existed may not have
// the file yet, and an unconditional apply would fail the whole configuration.
