# embed-xcframework.sh — flavor-aware KMP framework embed for Xcode (E6).
#
# Invoked as an Xcode Run-Script build phase on the `iosApp` target (see
# iosApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj → PBXShellScriptBuildPhase "[KMP] Embed and
# Sign ComposeApp XCFramework"). It runs BEFORE Compile Sources so the exported
# `ComposeApp` framework is built, code-signed and copied into the app bundle for
# every build. This is the SwiftPM/XCFramework embed path; the framework is linked
# from the XCFramework this script assembles, not from any package-manager phase.
#
# ── Flavor-aware build-type mapping ──
# Every `{flavor}{BuildType}` Xcode configuration (demoDebug, demoStaging,
# demoRelease, prodDebug, prodStaging, prodRelease — from the kmp-product-flavors DSL)
# maps to a Kotlin/Native build type: a *debuggable* build type → DEBUG, everything
# else → RELEASE. That selection is derived here from Xcode's `$CONFIGURATION`:
#     *Debug  -> Debug   (debuggable)
#     *        -> Release (Staging + Release are optimized/non-debuggable)
# The KMP `embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode` task only understands the canonical
# `Debug`/`Release` configuration names, so we hand it the mapped name via the
# `CONFIGURATION` env var — that is what makes per-variant iOS builds work.

# The app consumes ComposeApp as a SwiftPM BINARY TARGET (cmp-ios/Package.swift → the XCFramework at
# cmp-shared/build/XCFrameworks/<type>/ComposeApp.xcframework). Kotlin REJECTS
# `embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode` — the direct-integration task — the moment the Xcode project
# carries SwiftPM dependencies ("error: You have SwiftPM dependencies with embedAndSign integration"),
# which it now does: the native Firebase SDK + the ComposeApp binary target itself. So we ASSEMBLE the
# XCFramework the binary target points at; Xcode/SwiftPM embed + sign the binary product automatically
# when resolving the package. This runs BEFORE Compile Sources so the freshly-built framework is what
# links. (Debug/Release maps from Xcode's flavored $CONFIGURATION above.)
# ── FAST PATH: a Debug build needs ONE architecture, not an XCFramework ──────────────────────
# An XCFramework contains every slice BY DEFINITION, so assembleComposeApp*XCFramework compiles BOTH
# iosArm64 (device) and iosSimulatorArm64 even when the destination is a simulator. Measured
# 2026-09-16 on this project: 11m26s of Gradle / 1576 tasks inside ONE xcodebuild, dominated by
# checkIosArm64* + the device-arch Kotlin/Native compile that a simulator run never loads.
#
# The app links ComposeApp from FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS (see the staging block below), NOT as a
# SwiftPM product — only the Firebase SDK is. So a Debug build links the SINGLE arch matching
# $SDK_NAME and stages it directly, skipping the other arch and the fat/XCFramework packaging.
# That is the same principle `embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode` applies (build what $SDK_NAME /
# $ARCHS asks for); it is hand-rolled here only because Kotlin REJECTS embedAndSign once the project
# carries SwiftPM dependencies, as explained above.
#
# RELEASE still assembles the full XCFramework: Package.swift's binaryTarget and the deploy lanes
# consume it, and a distribution build must carry every slice.
