# remove-demo.sh — strip the kmp-project-template demo showcase, leaving a clean fork.
#
# Invoked by `scripts/white-label/fork-init.sh --clean`. Convention (showcase-framework-separation epic):
#   • demo domain code lives under **/demo/** packages,
#   • demo feature modules are include()d inside a `// demo:begin … // demo:end` block
#     in settings.gradle.kts,
#   • demo entries in central files (@Database, Koin modules, store registry) are wrapped
#     in `// demo:begin … // demo:end` markers.
#
# Removal = strip every marked block + delete every **/demo/** package + delete the demo
# feature modules + reset the DB schema to a fresh-fork baseline + swap the demo-coupled
# app shell (home dashboard + nav) for a minimal placeholder.
#
# NOTE: feature-name regex accepts [A-Za-z0-9_-]+ (Kotlin-idiomatic include(":feature:PascalCase")
# + digit-suffixed feature dirs are legal). Regression-tested by
# tests/fixtures/remove-demo-regex-canary/{red,green}/.
#
# Usage:
#   remove-demo.sh                 # DRY RUN (default) — report what would change, touch nothing
#   remove-demo.sh --apply         # actually perform the removal

#
#     This used to be inferred by awk-ing between `# demo:begin`/`# demo:end` in app.yaml, which is
#     positional and could not express `supabase_data` — its point sat OUTSIDE the fence while its
#     `api:` sat inside, so the facade survived the strip and needed a second, separate parser. One
#     declared field per entry replaces both parsers and cannot drift from what it describes.

# *.yaml included so app-profile's fenced demo blocks are stripped too. Test fixtures are EXCLUDED:
# `scripts/product-health/tests/**` holds RED/GREEN canary trees whose whole purpose is to CONTAIN
# demo fences (wls3-seam-fenced, wls4-demo-loose, network-buildkonfig). Stripping them turns every
# RED fixture green, silently disabling the gates that verify the white-label machinery — the strip
# would quietly break its own safety net.
#
# `core/*/module-packages.yaml` is excluded for a different reason: its demo rows must SURVIVE the
# strip so each can be stamped `status: removed`. Deleting the row instead deletes the RECORD — and
# the record is the whole point, because `/kmp-project-template-sync` then cannot tell a package the
# customizer removed on purpose from one that went missing, and "restore it" is right in exactly one
# of those cases. The rows stay; only their status changes.

#     `DEMO_POINTS` above already had to be captured early for the same reason; these now are too.
# Each module declares its own packages in `core/<module>/module-packages.yaml` (three-value
# vocabulary: demo | template | fork). ONLY `owner: demo` is deleted — `template` is framework code a
# clean fork keeps, and `fork` is the fork's own. The two-value scheme this replaced used

#     …and DROP the exported schema history with it. Version, autoMigrations and the exported

#     with a cleaned fork's v1 of four infra tables. Leaving them behind is not cosmetic — the first
#     time the fork bumps its ledger version, Room validates its auto-migration
#     against the template's stale N.json and computes a migration between unrelated schemas.
#     Deleting them makes the fork's first build export its own v1 from its own @Database.
#     The generated-region surgery that used to live here is GONE. AppDatabase is no longer
#     committed source: `@DbEntity` / `@DbDao` / `@DbConverters` on the classes are the declaration,
#     and `tools/database-ksp` derives AppDatabase + GeneratedDaoBindings into build/generated. Step
#     4b2 deletes the demo packages, which takes their annotations with them, so the next build simply
