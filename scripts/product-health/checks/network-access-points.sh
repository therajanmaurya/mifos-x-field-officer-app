#!/usr/bin/env bash
# checks/network-access-points.sh — app-profile is the ONLY place a network endpoint is declared,
# and every derived surface is a faithful projection of it.
#
# `app-profile/app.yaml#network.access_points` is the SoT. `./gradlew syncForkConfig` projects it onto
# four committed Kotlin surfaces:
#
#   AppAccessPoints.kt        the registry list          (NAP-1 ids · NAP-2 fields)
#   AppUrlTypes.kt            the UrlType vocabulary     (NAP-3)
#   di/GeneratedApiBindings.kt the Koin bindings         (NAP-4)
#   AppSupabaseAnonKeys.kt    the per-point anon keys    (NAP-5 rows · NAP-6 no committed key)
#   core/network/build.gradle.kts  the BuildKonfig fields (NAP-8 every referenced field is declared)
#   core/network/<id>/             the per-endpoint package  (NAP-9 exists · NAP-10 supabase id=ref)
#
# WHY a gate and not just codegen: the generated files are COMMITTED (the build must work on a fresh
# clone with no Gradle run), so nothing forces them to still match app.yaml. Whoever edits app.yaml
# and forgets `syncForkConfig` gets a repo that compiles and is wrong. That is not hypothetical —
# AppUrlTypes was hand-kept and had drifted to 3 constants against 8 declared points, and the drift
# was SILENT AND WRONG-ANSWERING: AppMultiUrlConfigProvider.getBaseUrl falls back to UrlType.MAIN for
# an unrecognised type, so a lookup for an undeclared endpoint returned the MAIN base URL rather than
# failing. NAP-3 is that bug's gate.
#
# NAP-7 closes the loop: wiring must go THROUGH the generated file. A hand-added restApi(...) line
# re-creates the drift the codegen removes (a binding with no declared endpoint, or an endpoint whose
# binding nobody regenerates), so it is refused even though it compiles.
