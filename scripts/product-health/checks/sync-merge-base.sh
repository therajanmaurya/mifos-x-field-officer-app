# checks/sync-merge-base.sh — an `owner: merge` row must actually 3-way, not silently full-copy.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS CATCHES
# `owner: merge` is the contract's promise that a template update and a fork's edits BOTH survive.
# The engine keeps that promise with `git merge-file ours base theirs` — and the promise is only as
# good as `base`. Two fork topologies exist:
#
#   forked  `gh repo fork` / clone of the template. Shares history, so `git merge-base` works.
#   copied  the template TREE copied into a fresh repo — the common case in practice. Different root
#           commits, ZERO shared commits, and `git merge-base` returns EMPTY.
#
# With an empty base the engine used `ours` as the base. `git merge-file` then sees every template
# difference as a clean addition onto an untouched base and takes ALL of theirs — reproducing exactly
# the full-copy that `merge` exists to prevent. It printed "Merged (…) — fork edits preserved" while
# doing it, so the loss was invisible in the log AND in the diff.
#
# Measured on mbs/cappy 2026-09-10: zero shared commits with openMF/kmp-project-template, and 11
# platform-shell files (Info.plist's OAuth CFBundleURLTypes, the WidgetKit app-group entitlement, a
# whole CappyWidgets Xcode target) that a degraded merge would have taken from the template wholesale.
#
# `.template-version#template_sha` is the anchor for the copied case — it records the template commit
# the tree last synced FROM, which is precisely the ancestor git cannot compute across unrelated
# histories. Its own file header already said it "anchors the next sync's 3-way merge base"; the merge
# loops simply were not reading it. That gap is what these checks pin.
#
#   MB-1  resolve_merge_base() exists and consults PREV_TEMPLATE_SHA
#   MB-2  every merge loop resolves its base through it — no bare `git merge-base` assignment
#   MB-3  a missing base is WARNED about, never reported as a successful merge
#   MB-4  the engine refuses to line-merge a binary
#   MB-5  the four platform application shells resolve `merge` (they carry fork platform wiring
#         that has no other seam — an Xcode target and a plist key have nowhere else to live)
#   MB-6  .template-version carries a parseable template_sha (the anchor MB-1 depends on)

# upstream deletion, so the merge drops it and still reports "fork edits preserved". Keyed on the
# `: > "$_b"` empty-base seeding plus a warning, not on one literal string, so rewording the message
# does not silently disarm the check (which is exactly what happened when it read 'No merge base for').
