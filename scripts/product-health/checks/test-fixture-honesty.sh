# test-fixture-honesty.sh — a test fixture must PRODUCE the failure mode it claims.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# `ErrorCategory.categorize()` keys Network off the exception's CLASS-NAME chain, not its message —
# commonMain has no shared `IOException` to test against, so the name is all there is. That makes one
# particular fixture silently wrong:
#
#     Fetcher.of { throw RuntimeException("no network") }      // reads like an offline failure
#
# It categorizes `Generic`, so `isExpectedWhenOffline()` rejects it, `DecisionEngine` falls through to
# NoNetwork instead of the offline-first Empty, and the test asserting offline-first behaviour passes
# for the wrong reason — or races, passing on a fast machine and failing under instrumentation.
#
# That is not hypothetical. It shipped in `ScreenDataStreamIntegrationTest`, presented as a flaky
# test, and the honest fix was `FakeIOException` — a NAME the categorizer recognises. The message was
# always right; the type was always wrong.
#
# The tell is mechanical: the MESSAGE claims network semantics while the CLASS NAME does not deliver
# them. That gap is exactly what this check looks for.
#
#   TF-1 an exception whose message claims network/offline/connection semantics, thrown with a type
#        whose name is NOT Network-categorized (the patterns mirror ErrorCategory exactly)
# NOT IN SCOPE — unfailable assertions (`assertTrue(true …)`) are already owned by the shipped
# `no-vacuous-assert.sh` (VA-1/VA-2), which also handles the case where Spotless has WRAPPED the call
# across lines. A second scanner for the same defect would be weaker than the one that exists and
# would drift from it; this check deliberately covers only the fixture-type gap that nothing else does.
#
# TF-1 accepts a DECLARED exemption within three lines above (`// fixture-ok: <reason>`) — never an
# implied one. A fixture deliberately asserting the Generic path says so.
#
# Exit 0 = PASS · 1 = FAIL (blocks) · 2 = WARN. Pure bash + grep — no Kotlin reflection.
