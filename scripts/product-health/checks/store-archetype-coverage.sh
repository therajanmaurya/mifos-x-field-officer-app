#!/usr/bin/env bash
# store-archetype-coverage.sh — the 8 Store5 archetypes each keep a real showcase.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# The template's product IS the archetype demos. That contract used to live only as prose in
# CLAUDE.md, and the two "archetype contract" tests were `assertTrue(true, "...")` — unfailable. So a
# well-meaning "make every read cache-first" refactor converted MacroIndicatorStore from
# createMemoryStore to a Room-backed createStore, deleting the ONLY MEMORY_ONLY showcase, and every
# test still went green. This check makes that impossible.
#
# CONTRACT (core/store/STORE_ARCHETYPES.yaml is the source of truth)
#   AC-1 every archetype declares >= 1 showcase
#   AC-2 every declared showcase file exists
#   AC-3 every showcase actually calls its declared StoreFactory factory
#   AC-4 a showcase declaring cache_first:false carries a non-empty reason
#
# AC-3 is the load-bearing one: it compares the DECLARATION against the SOURCE, so changing a
# showcase's factory without updating the registry fails here.
#
# Exit 0 = PASS · 1 = FAIL (blocks) · 2 = WARN. Pure bash + grep/awk — no Kotlin reflection, so it
# runs identically on every platform and in CI.
