#
# app-profile is the fork SoT → derive.rb materializes gradle/fork.properties → everything else
# READS that bridge. The readers are:
#
#   Gradle  build-logic/convention/src/main/kotlin/org/convention/ForkProperties.kt
#   bash    scripts/_shared/fork-props.sh                      (fp_file / fp_get)
#   Ruby    deployment/_shared/project_config.rb               (FORK[...])
#
# WHY this is gated rather than merely documented: independent parsers are how resolution silently
# diverges, and it has already happened twice in this repo.
#   · 2026-09-06 — deployment/Appfile preferred the FILE while _shared/project_config.rb preferred
#     the ENV for the same apple.team.id, so the two could resolve DIFFERENT signing teams.
#   · Six Gradle files each ran Properties().load() with three helper shapes and three different
#     missing-key defaults; one of them silently shipped "App" as the settings-footer app name.
# Both were invisible until someone diffed the readers by hand. This check does that diff on every
# run, so a NEW hand-rolled parser fails immediately instead of years later at a signing desk.
#
# exit 0 PASS / 1 FAIL. Pure bash + grep (harness house style — no jq, no Ruby).
