# The generated network surfaces are COMMITTED, so a repo whose app.yaml has moved on still compiles
# and is still wrong. Every NAP rule therefore gets its own RED tree: one fixture, one defect, so a
# rule that silently stops detecting is caught here rather than years later.
#
# The failure modes are not equally loud, which is the point of gating all of them:
#   NAP-3 and NAP-6 produce NO compile error at all — a missing UrlType constant silently resolves to
#   MAIN's base URL, and a committed anon key works fine until someone needs to rotate it.
