#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run.sh — the generated API bindings must SURVIVE `remove-demo.sh` and be left coherent.
#
# GeneratedApiBindings.kt is derived from the FORK's app-profile, so it is not demo content — but it
# used to live under `core/network/.../demo/di/`, and remove-demo.sh deletes every `**/demo/**`
# package outright. That combination was silently destructive: `fork-init.sh` strips the demo BY
# DEFAULT ("forking = starting clean"), so a fork lost the generated file, and the generator's
# `if (!dir.isDirectory) return` guard then made every later syncForkConfig a NO-OP. A fork could
# declare an endpoint forever and never get a binding, with nothing reporting it.
#
# Moving the file to `di/` fixed that but created the opposite hazard: it survived while the demo API
# classes it bound were deleted, so remove-demo.sh had to reset it to its empty-module form. Neither
# hazard exists any more: the binding is declared by `@ApiBinding` ON the API class and generated
# into build/, so deleting an endpoint package deletes its declaration and there is no committed
# output to strand. remove-demo.sh still strips the fenced demo access points from app-profile, so a
# cleaned fork stops DECLARING endpoints it no longer has.
#
# `AppDatabase.kt` USED to carry the same hazard, and no longer can. Its entities/DAOs/converters
# were declared in `app-profile/app.yaml#database` and projected into committed `gen-*` regions, so
# the strip had to empty those regions by text surgery or a cleaned fork kept entities referencing
# classes step 4 had just deleted. The declaration is now the `@DbEntity` / `@DbDao` /
# `@DbConverters` annotation ON the class, and AppDatabase is generated into build/. Deleting a
# package therefore deletes its declaration — the output cannot outlive its classes, because there
# is no committed output. What this canary asserts for the database is that the DECLARATIONS go with
# their packages, and that the FRAMEWORK ones (core-base/database/module-schema.yaml) do not.
#
# The exported schema JSONs still go: they describe the TEMPLATE's lineage (v1 is a lone `samples`
# table), so a fork that later bumps its ledger version would have Room validate an auto-migration
# between two unrelated schemas.
#
# Asserted against the REAL repo files in a throwaway copy — never the working tree.
