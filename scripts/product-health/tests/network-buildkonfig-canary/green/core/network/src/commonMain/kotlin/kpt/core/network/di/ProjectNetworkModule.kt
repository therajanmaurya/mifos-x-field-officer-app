/**
 * THE FORK'S network DI seam. Empty on the neutral template — this is yours to fill.
 *
 * It lives outside any per-endpoint package on purpose, so `scripts/remove-demo.sh` leaves it
 * standing: a fork that runs the customizer (which strips the demo BY DEFAULT — "forking = starting
 * clean") keeps this file and can wire network DI immediately.
 *
 * There is no `DemoNetworkModule` any more. Endpoint code now lives in a package named for its
 * ACCESS POINT (`kpt.core.network.<id>.api` / `.dto` / `.config`), generated per declared endpoint,
 * so the demo's API types are deleted with their access points rather than with a `demo/` package.
 * What is left over is DI — and DI for a non-derivable single belongs here, demo-fenced.
 *
 * ## What does NOT go here
 * API client bindings. Every server is declared once in `app-profile/app.yaml#network.access_points`
 * and its Koin binding is GENERATED into [GeneratedApiBindings], which [NetworkModule] includes.
 * Adding a `restApi(...)`/`supabaseApi(...)` line here is refused by
 * `scripts/product-health/checks/network-access-points.sh` (NAP-7).
 *
 * ## What DOES go here
 * Network singles that cannot be derived from an endpoint declaration — request-time API-key configs,
 * interceptor/auth providers, custom serializers. Example:
 * ```
 * single<MyApiConfig> { MyApiConfig(apiKey = BuildKonfig.MY_API_KEY.takeIf { it.isNotBlank() }) }
 * ```
