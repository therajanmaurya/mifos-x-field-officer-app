package kpt.core.network.fred.config

/**
 * Runtime configuration for [kpt.core.network.fred.api.FredApi].
 *
 * The fork is responsible for sourcing the key — typical patterns:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // BuildKonfig (preferred)
 * single { FredApiConfig(apiKey = BuildKonfig.FRED_API_KEY) }
 *
 * // System env / Gradle property
 * single { FredApiConfig(apiKey = System.getenv("FRED_API_KEY")) }
 *
 * // Hardcoded for local dev (NEVER commit)
 * single { FredApiConfig(apiKey = "deadbeef...") }
 * ```
 *
 * `apiKey` is intentionally nullable so the toolkit can ship demo data when no
 * key is configured — the repository layer surfaces an explicit "FRED key not
 * configured" error rather than firing the network request with `apiKey=null`.
