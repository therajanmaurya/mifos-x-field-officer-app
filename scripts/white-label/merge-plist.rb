# merge-plist.rb — key-level 3-way union for Info.plist / *.entitlements.
#
# WHY NOT git merge-file
# These files are a flat top-level <dict> where template and fork each add their OWN keys. The
# additions land at the same place in the text — just inside <dict> — so a line merge can report a
# conflict for changes that do not overlap in meaning.
#
# Measured on mbs/cappy ⋈ template 2026-09-10, against each file's REAL ancestor:
#
#   iosApp.entitlements  ADD/ADD — absent at the fork's base b97eb73d (the template added its own
#                        in 99083ed2, the fork added its own separately). No ancestor, so a line
#                        merge CONFLICTS, and the result does not even parse:
#                        `plutil: Encountered unexpected character = on line 15`. The build breaks.
#                        This file is why the strategy exists.
#   Info.plist           has a real ancestor, and a line merge is currently CLEAN — 0 conflicts,
#                        CFBundleURLTypes preserved, plutil OK. It is routed here anyway because it
#                        is the same flat-dict shape and one template key added near the fork's
#                        block turns it into the entitlements case. Correct today, robust tomorrow —
#                        not a fix for a present breakage, and this comment should not imply it is.
#
# (An earlier draft of this header claimed BOTH files were add/add with 2 conflicts each. That came
# from a broken measurement — the base was extracted with `"$SHA:cmp-ios/…"` in zsh, where `:c` is
# eaten as a modifier, so every `git show` silently returned nothing and every file looked add/add.
# Quote it `"${SHA}:cmp-ios/…"`.)
#
# The keys involved are genuinely disjoint and both are required:
#   template  keychain-access-groups          core-base/datastore's KeychainSettings needs it, or
#                                             iOS fails errSecMissingEntitlement (-34018) at launch
#   fork      com.apple.security.application-groups   the WidgetKit shared container
#   fork      CFBundleURLTypes                the OAuth redirect scheme — delete it and sign-in
#                                             silently never returns to the app
# Neither side may win. The merge is a UNION.
#
# WHY TEXT-LEVEL RATHER THAN parse-and-rewrite
# Round-tripping through a plist parser is easier and loses every comment. That is not cosmetic
# here: the template's entitlements carries 14 lines explaining WHY the keychain group is required
# and what happens without it — exactly the knowledge a fork needs when it later edits the file.
# So this merges at the text level, treating each key and its value element (plus the comments
# attached above it) as an opaque block. Comments survive because they are never re-serialized.
#

#          --base -   there is no common ancestor (add/add); union both sides
#   exit 0 merged · 1 undecidable difference (nothing written) · 2 usage/IO error
