# merge-pbxproj.rb — a 3-way merge for Xcode project files that produces NO conflict markers.
#
# WHY A DEDICATED MERGER
# `project.pbxproj` is the one file in the sync surface where a line-based 3-way is structurally
# wrong. It is not a document, it is a SERIALIZED OBJECT GRAPH: ~50 objects keyed by stable 24-hex
# UUIDs, where "add a target" rewrites a UUID list three levels away from the object it adds. git
# merge-file sees adjacent lines in a container array and calls it a conflict; worse, a merge marker
# inside a pbxproj makes the project UNOPENABLE, so a human cannot even use Xcode to resolve it.
#
# WHY IT IS TRACTABLE ANYWAY
# The UUIDs are stable ACROSS THE FORK BOUNDARY. Measured template ⋈ mbs/cappy 2026-09-10:
# 36 and 52 objects, **33 UUIDs shared** — a fork's project descends from the template's, so the
# same object carries the same key on both sides. That turns an intractable text merge into an
# ordinary keyed 3-way, and every real difference falls into exactly three mechanical classes:
#
#   1. UUID-LIST additions        PBXProject.targets / .packageReferences, PBXGroup.children,
#                                 PBXSourcesBuildPhase.files, PBXNativeTarget.buildPhases …
#                                 Template added XCLocalSwiftPackageReference (the SwiftPM
#                                 migration); the fork added a CappyWidgets target. Different
#                                 elements of the same array → UNION. No judgement needed.
#   2. buildSettings KEY additions  the fork added CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS; the template adds its
#                                 own keys over time → per-key union.
#   3. buildSettings VALUE conflict  exactly one in the measured pair:
#                                 DEVELOPMENT_TEAM "$(TEAM_ID)" (template placeholder) vs
#                                 L432S2FZP5 (the fork's real team). Fork identity → fork wins.
#
# So this is not heuristic reconstruction — it is a keyed 3-way with a union rule for arrays and a
# declared precedence for the identity keys. Anything it CANNOT decide is reported and the merge
# FAILS loudly, because a silently-wrong pbxproj costs more than a stopped sync.
#
# The `xcodeproj` gem does the parsing and (critically) the WRITING — it is already resolved in
# Gemfile.lock as a fastlane transitive (1.28.1), so this adds no dependency. Writing through the
# gem is what keeps Xcode's canonical formatting and the `/* comment */` annotations intact.
#
#   usage: merge-pbxproj.rb --ours <f> --base <f> --theirs <f> --out <f> [--report]
#   exit 0 merged · 1 undecidable difference (nothing written) · 2 usage/IO error

# ── Identity build settings: PREFER THE INDIRECTION, never a literal ────────
# The first version of this list said "fork wins" for these keys, on the reasoning that they are
# per-fork deployment identity. That is right about the VALUE and wrong about the LOCATION, and
# picking the fork's literal would have entrenched the exact defect the template just finished
# removing.
#
# None of these is authored in the pbxproj at all. Each is an INDIRECTION resolved from
# Config.xcconfig, which syncForkConfig generates from the app-profile SoT:
#
#   app-profile/platforms/apple/apple.yaml#apple.team_id
#     → gradle/fork.properties#apple.team.id        (derive.rb, AppProfile::MAP)
#     → Config.xcconfig#TEAM_ID                     (SyncForkConfigPlugin)
#     → $(TEAM_ID)                                  ← what the pbxproj must contain
#
# So a LITERAL here is a defect no matter which side wrote it — syncForkConfig never touches
# project.pbxproj, so nothing downstream can correct one. This template shipped
# `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = L432S2FZP5` to every fork through two commits and it survived until
# 2026-09-10; `PBX-4` in product-health/checks/ios-pbxproj-identity.sh now blocks the recurrence.
#
# The merge rule follows from that: whichever side holds the `$(…)` indirection wins. It is
# direction-agnostic — it repairs a fork that hardcoded a value AND declines to import a literal
# the template leaked — and it needs no notion of "who owns this", because the answer is always
# "app-profile does".

# earlier attempt to filter inside merge_list wrote a guard that could never fire (it tested whether
# an element of `ours` was in `ours`). The result: `Configs/iOSApp.xcconfig`, deleted upstream and
# untouched by the fork, had its object dropped while the PBXGroup child reference survived — a
# DANGLING REFERENCE. The gem discards those on load with a warning, so the merge "succeeded" while
# silently losing whatever the reference pointed at.
