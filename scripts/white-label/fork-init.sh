#
# fork-init — turn a template clone into a branded, demo-free consumer fork.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/white-label/fork-init.sh <package_id> <project_name> [app_display_name] [ios_team_id] [--keep-demo]
#   bash scripts/white-label/fork-init.sh --clean [--apply]            # standalone demo removal (no identity change)
#
# Example:
#   bash scripts/white-label/fork-init.sh com.mybank.app MyBankApp "My Bank" ABCDE12345
#   bash scripts/white-label/fork-init.sh com.mybank.app MyBankApp "My Bank" ABCDE12345 --keep-demo
#
# What this does (identity mode):
#   1. Brands `app-profile/app.yaml` — THE source of truth. identity.app_id / app_name / namespace,
#      plus the `org:` block (vendor, copyright) when --org= is given.
#   2. Runs ./gradlew syncForkConfig, which DERIVES gradle/fork.properties, libs.versions.toml,
#      iOS Config.xcconfig, local.properties (Fastlane) and gradle.properties FROM app-profile.
#   3. Removes the demo showcase (scripts/remove-demo.sh) so the fork starts from a
#      clean, branded framework shell — this is the DEFAULT. Pass --keep-demo to retain
#      the Money-Toolkit demo (for exploring the framework's reference features).
#
# SCOPE: app-profile only — app.yaml (identity + org block) and platforms/apple/apple.yaml's
# ORG-scope signing identity (team id, Match git url/branch), inherited from the workspace's
# _org/company.yaml via --org=. Per-app deployment values that are NOT org-wide — Firebase app ids,
# store metadata, per-target config — stay DEPLOYMENT-LAYER scope and arrive via promote.
#
# fork.properties and libs.versions.toml are NOT written here at all — syncForkConfig derives both
# from app-profile. Branding them directly is a no-op that reports success; see the note at the
# derived-files section below.
#
# No source file scanning, no package renaming, no sync-dirs conflicts. The convention plugin
# derives all module namespaces from the framework-owned BASE_MODULE_NAMESPACE constant (kpt) —
# a fixed template label never exposed to the consumer. Fork identity is never touched by the demo removal.
